# PBI-001: Workstreams Extension

## Summary
Add workstreams feature to claude-memory MCP to consolidate scattered conversations into topic buckets.

## User Story
As a user with multiple Claude conversations across topics, I want to organize context into named workstreams so that I can quickly catch up on any topic and avoid repeating decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Schema: 4 new tables (workstreams, decisions, chat_index, open_questions)
- [ ] Tools: workstream_list, workstream_create, workstream_read, workstream_update, workstream_delete
- [ ] Tools: decision_add, decision_supersede, decision_list
- [ ] Tools: chat_register, chat_list
- [ ] Tools: question_add, question_resolve, question_list
- [ ] Seed: Initial 6 workstreams populated
- [ ] Tests: All new tools have test coverage

## Dependencies
None - extends existing claude-memory

## Estimated Scope
- Schema: 1 file change (schema.ts)
- Types: 1 file change (types.ts)
- Handlers: 1 new file (handlers/workstream.ts)
- Registration: 1 file change (index.ts)
- Tests: 1 new file
