# PBI-025: Filter Tool Call Messages from Feed

## Status

**Superseded by PBI-029** - Transcript polling shows text content by default, tool calls optional. Filtering no longer needed.

## User Story
As a user, I want wagui to show only meaningful conversation content so that the feed isn't cluttered with tool operation noise.

## Problem
Currently every tool call (Read, Write, Bash, etc.) appears as a context divider in the wagui feed. This makes the conversation unreadable - actual discussion is buried under tool operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tool operations don't appear as messages by default
- [ ] Only conversation content (chat, proposal, review, decision) is shown
- [ ] Optional: toggle to show/hide tool operations
- [ ] Tests written for new code

## Technical Notes
Need to identify where tool calls are being sent to wagui:
- Is it coming from wag MCP server?
- Or from a hook that broadcasts all tool use?

## Priority
P1 - Makes wagui usable

## Dependencies
None

## Estimate
Small - likely just filtering logic
