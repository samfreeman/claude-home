# PBI-003: Teams-Style Chat Bubble Layout

## User Story
As a developer, I want messages displayed as compact chat bubbles (like Microsoft Teams) so that I can see more conversation history without scrolling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] User messages right-aligned
- [x] Other roles (PM, Architect, Dev) left-aligned with avatar/initials
- [x] Role name displayed above message bubble
- [x] Uniform dark bubble color for all messages (not colored by role)
- [x] Only avatar circle is color-coded by role
- [x] Compact vertical spacing between messages
- [x] Timestamp displayed inline (not in separate header)
- [x] Message type indicator (emoji) inline with content
- [x] Approve/Reject badges inline for review messages
- [x] Auto-scroll to bottom when new messages arrive
- [ ] Tests written for new code

## Technical Notes
- Redesign Message.tsx component
- Remove Card-based layout, use flex with conditional alignment
- Avatar: circle with role initials (U, PM, A, D)
- Avatar colors: User=purple, PM=purple-muted, Architect=amber, Dev=green
- Bubble color: uniform dark (e.g., zinc-800/900)
- Keep metadata (file, PBI) as small badges when present

## Design Reference
- Microsoft Teams chat layout
- Right-align "self" messages, left-align "others"
- Minimal chrome, focus on content

## Dependencies
- None

## Estimate
Medium - UI redesign of single component
