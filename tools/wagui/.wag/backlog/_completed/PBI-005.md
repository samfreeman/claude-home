# PBI-005: Context Dividers in Chat

## User Story
As a developer, I want visual dividers in the chat when context changes so that I can easily see when modes switched or a new PBI was selected.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Divider appears when mode changes (DOCS → ADR → DEV)
- [x] Divider appears when PBI is selected/changed
- [x] Divider shows relevant context (mode name, PBI number)
- [x] Dividers are visually distinct from messages
- [x] All user messages appear in wagui conversation history
- [x] Interruptions are logged with context about what was interrupted
- [x] Tests written for new code

## Technical Notes
- Detect context changes from message headers
- Compare current message header to previous
- Render divider component between messages when context differs
- Style: horizontal line with centered label
- wagu.md must require forwarding ALL user messages
- wagu.md must handle `[Request interrupted by user]` by logging what was interrupted

## Dependencies
- PBI-004 (layout fixes)

## Estimate
Small
