# PBI-004: Fix Layout - Sticky Header and Scrollable Message Area

## User Story
As a developer, I want the header to stay visible and messages to scroll independently so that I can always see context while viewing the latest messages.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Header stays fixed at top (sticky/fixed positioning)
- [x] Message area scrolls independently within its container
- [x] Auto-scroll to bottom works when new messages arrive
- [x] Layout supports future sidebars (flex-based structure)
- [x] Full viewport height utilized (no page-level scrolling)
- [ ] Tests written for new code

## Technical Notes
- Fix page.tsx layout to use flex with fixed header
- MessageList should be the only scrollable element
- Investigate ScrollArea ref issue for auto-scroll
- Consider using CSS `overflow-y: auto` on message container
- Header: `sticky top-0` or `fixed` positioning

## Bug Reference
- Auto-scroll from PBI-003 not functioning correctly
- ScrollArea ref may not be forwarding correctly

## Dependencies
- None

## Estimate
Small-Medium - Layout restructuring
