# PBI-006: Theme Support with tweakcn

## User Story
As a developer, I want wagui to use the Solar Dusk theme from tweakcn so that the UI has a warm, distinctive look and can easily swap themes in the future.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Solar Dusk theme installed and applied
- [ ] Theme CSS variables properly integrated with Tailwind
- [ ] Dark/light mode toggle works with new theme
- [ ] Existing components render correctly with new colors
- [ ] Tests written for new code

## Technical Notes
- Use `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://tweakcn.com/r/themes/solar-dusk.json`
- tweakcn generates oklch color variables for Tailwind v4
- May need to update globals.css with theme variables
- Verify shadcn components pick up new theme colors

## Future Considerations
- Theme picker UI for switching between themes
- Store theme preference in localStorage
- Additional themes from tweakcn

## Dependencies
- None

## Estimate
Small - theme installation and CSS integration
