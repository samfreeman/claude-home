# PBI-022: Isolated Playwright Test Ports

## User Story
As a developer, I want Playwright e2e tests to use different ports than the dev instance so that running tests doesn't clear my monitoring screen or interfere with active development.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Tests use separate server port (e.g., 3199 instead of 3099)
- [x] Tests use separate frontend port (e.g., 3198 instead of 3098)
- [x] Tests spin up their own isolated instances via playwright.config.ts webServer
- [x] Dev instance remains unaffected when tests run
- [x] Tests use isolated SQLite database (not shared with dev)
- [x] Tests written for new code

## Technical Notes
- Update playwright.config.ts webServer commands with different ports
- Server needs to accept PORT env var or command-line arg
- Frontend (Next.js) already supports --port flag
- Consider using TEST_SERVER_PORT and TEST_FRONTEND_PORT env vars
- May need separate data directory for test SQLite
- Update existing e2e tests (clear.spec.ts) to use new test ports

## Dependencies
- None

## Estimate
Small
