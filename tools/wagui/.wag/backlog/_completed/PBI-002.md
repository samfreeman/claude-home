# PBI-002: Add Clear Messages Button

## User Story
As a developer, I want to clear all messages from the UI so that I can start fresh when testing or switching contexts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Clear button in header or message area
- [x] Clears local message state
- [x] Optionally calls `wag_clear` on MCP server
- [x] Confirmation dialog before clearing
- [x] Tests written for new code

## Technical Notes
- Add button to Header component
- May need API route to call wag_clear (or just clear local state)
- Consider whether to clear SQLite too

## Dependencies
- PBI-001 (if clearing persisted messages)

## Estimate
Small
