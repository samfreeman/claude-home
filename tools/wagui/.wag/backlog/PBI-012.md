# PBI-012: Display File Path in Chat Messages

## User Story
As a developer, I want to see which file is being modified directly in chat messages so that I can track changes without looking at a separate panel.

## Problem
When Claude Code sends diff or proposal messages, the file being modified is not clearly visible in the message bubble. Users have to infer which file is changing from context.

The `file` metadata field exists in `wag_send_message` but wagui doesn't display it prominently.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Diff messages show the file path in the message header
- [ ] Proposal messages show the file path when applicable
- [ ] File path is visually distinct (not buried in content)
- [ ] Tests written for new code

## Technical Notes

### Current State
```typescript
wag_send_message({
    role: 'dev',
    type: 'diff',
    content: '...',
    file: 'src/components/Chat.tsx'  // ← Exists but not displayed
})
```

### Proposed UI
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ DEV · diff                          │
│ 📄 src/components/Chat.tsx          │  ← Add file path here
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│  - old code                         │
│  + new code                         │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Implementation
In `MessageBubble.tsx`, check for `message.metadata?.file` and render it below the role/type header.

## Priority
P1 - Quick win, improves UX significantly

## Dependencies
- None

## Estimate
Small - UI change only, data already available
