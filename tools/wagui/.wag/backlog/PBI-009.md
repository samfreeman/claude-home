# PBI-009: Clarify Role Ownership in ADR Mode

## User Story
As a user of WAGU, I want clear role boundaries in ADR mode so that PBIs are written by PM, ADRs by Architect, and documentation stays in sync.

## Problem
Current ADR mode has unclear role ownership:
- Architect sometimes writes PBIs (should be PM)
- PRD and Architecture.md drift out of sync when scope/patterns change
- No explicit prompt to update docs when making changes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] wagu.md updated with clear role ownership:
  - PM owns: PBIs, PRD, backlog
  - Architect owns: ADRs, Architecture.md
- [ ] ADR mode flow includes doc sync checkpoints
- [ ] When new PBI is created, PM checks if PRD needs update
- [ ] When new pattern is introduced, Architect checks Architecture.md
- [ ] wagu.md includes "ADR Mode Outputs" section
- [ ] Clarify that product docs can be updated in BOTH modes

## Proposed Role Ownership

| Artifact | Owner | When to Update |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| PBI (backlog/) | PM | New feature/fix identified |
| PRD.md | PM | Scope expands or changes |
| ADR (adr/) | Architect | Technical approach decided |
| Architecture.md | Architect | New pattern or technology introduced |
| decisions.md | Both | Any significant decision |

## Docs Can Be Updated in Both Modes

**DOCS Mode:** Dedicated time for doc updates, big-picture planning, backlog grooming
**ADR Mode:** Focused on specific PBI/ADR, but can update docs when decisions warrant it

Product docs (PRD, Architecture.md, backlog) are living documents that can be impacted by work in either mode. The difference is intent:
- DOCS mode: "Let's update our docs"
- ADR mode: "We're making a decision that happens to require a doc update"

## ADR Mode Flow (Updated)

1. PM introduces PBI and business context
2. Architect explores codebase, proposes approach
3. User ↔ Architect discuss trade-offs
4. Architect writes/updates ADR
5. **Doc sync checkpoint:**
   - Architect: "Does this introduce new patterns for Architecture.md?"
   - PM: "Does this expand scope for PRD? Any new PBIs identified?"
6. PM creates any new PBIs identified during discussion
7. Approve ADR

## Priority
P1 - Process improvement that affects all future work

## Dependencies
- None

## Estimate
Small - documentation/process change to wagu.md
