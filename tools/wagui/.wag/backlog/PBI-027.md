# PBI-027: Parse Tool Use from Transcripts

## User Story

As a developer watching wagui, I want to see tool use activity from the transcript so I know what Claude is doing.

## Problem

Transcript polling only parses `type: 'text'` content blocks, skipping `type: 'tool_use'` blocks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tool use entries from transcript are parsed and sent as messages
- [ ] Uses existing tool use message format (PBI-021)
- [ ] Tests written for new code

## Technical Notes

Update `parseTranscriptEntry` in `server/transcript.ts` to handle `tool_use` blocks.

## Priority

P2

## Estimate

Small
